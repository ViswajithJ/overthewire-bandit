There was 9 files inside a directory in which only one is in ASCII format
I just tried cat with all.

Could have used `file ./*` to list out all files and their types

Each of these challenges have multiple solutions. 

Some are easy
Some are efficient
Some just get the job done

password for level 6 - P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU
 

- Command used
	- `ls -la -r ./*` - listed out all files recursively
	- `ls -la -r ./* | grep 1033` - grep 1033 from output

I used nmap to scan. 5 ports where open. 
Then i bruteforced(tried each port)

Got the private key

Cannot login. Just as we login, it says byebye and connection is closed.
Given that changes were made to bashrc to close connection as soon as we login. The password for next level was stored in a readme file in home directory


Got to learn that we can actually execute commands directly via ssh (immeadiately as we login).
We just have to append the command at the end of the ssh command.

So i append cat command as end of ssh to read the readme file.

This execution will happen even before .bashrc is executed. So readme file will be read before we get logged out.

Password for level 19 - awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC

There was an executable binary in home. It sets setuid bit
Basically it means it give power of the group/user it belongs to

Password was in the default folder, but can be read only by user bandit20. Since this binary gives me the power of bandit20, I used it to read the pass file.

Password for level 20 - VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT

A good one. There was a binary.
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21). (from site)

I listened in port 3000 using netcat on one instance. Then i connected to port 3000 using the binary from another instance. Then I passed current password through the first instance and 2nd instance sent the password for next level

Password for level 21 - NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq

- Commands used -
	- `nc -lv 3000`        -    Listens on port 3000 of localhost (-l for listen)

A cronjob was running by bandit24. script is visible. It executes files with owner "bandit23" and deletes all files in a directory. That directory is readable by bandit24 only. But bandit23 has write permissions in that dir. 
I got to /tmp and wrote(kinda it was already there by somebody else) a  script to cat out the password of bandit24 from bandit_pass/badnit24 file .
Got the flag.

Tuff one

- Given: ssh privatekey for bandit26 is given in home directory.
 	     shell for bandit26 is not /bin/bash.
When logged in using ssh and private key, it immediately logs out.
Tried passing commands along with ssh command to no avail.
Checked /etc/passwd file from bandit25's shell. Found out the shell for bandit26 user is /usr/bin/showtext
Navigated to /home/bandit26 to find that there are two files bandit27-do (prolly for next chal) and text.txt.
No permissions (currently bandit25).
opened showtext file to find that it sets TERM=linux and reads text.txt with `more` command. Then it exits(0).
Thats why it logs out.

Referred some walkthroughs. 
Apparently, the file is so small that the `more` commands output buffer won't exceed screen size and, thus finishes file and returns exit(0). This logs out the connection.
Reduced screen size so small that buffered text would not fit in the screen. 
It seems you could type `v` inside the result of `more` command to open vi, and,
read an external file, using `:r` command inside vi.

- Commands used:-
	- `ssh -i key_26.txt bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`
	- `:r /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` (Inside vi)

<h2>üî∞ Level - 26</h2>

- username - bandit26

There was a bandit27-do, a setuid file in home directory for bandit26. 
Logged in to bandit26 like in previous level. 
Entered `v` to open v within `more` .
Then used vi commands to set shell back to /bin/bash. Now normal bash commands would work
Executed the setuid binary to `cat` the passkey file from the `/etc/bandit_pass` directory.

- Commands used:-
	- `:set shell=/bin/bash`
	- `:!ls`
	- `:!./bandit27-do`
	- `:!./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`

A link to a git repo was given.
`ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`
We should clone the repo as bandit27-git (same password as bandit27) using port 2220 and get our flag.

I tried the normal `git clone command` but didn't. Said some issues with permissions.
I didnt how to specify port in this command. Also my home direcotory didnt have write permissions.
So I had to make a temp dir in /tmp.

So when I specified the port to be used is 2220, cloning was successfully done. Inside the repo was a readme file with the flag.

- Commands used:- 
	- `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost:2220/home/bandit27-git/repo`

Similar to the previous file. Instead of password, the contents of readme were :-

# Bandit Notes
Some notes for level29 of bandit.
credentials

It was evident that there was a password and they must have changed it. (Prolly).
So I tried git log to see other commits and indeed there it was, the previous commit replaced the password string with
